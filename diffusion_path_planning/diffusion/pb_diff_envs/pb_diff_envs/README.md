‚öôÔ∏è Environments in Potential Based Diffusion Motion Planning
-----------------------
<!-- **Status: Active Development** -->

LEMP (Learning-Enabled Motion Planning) is a light-weight framework that combines the power of machine learning with traditional motion planning techniques. With a focus on fast iteration, LEMP provides a rapid and agile solution solution for developing learning algorithms for motion planning tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Please see the `README.md` in `potential-motion-plan-release` for conda environment creation.
Training data and planning problems for evaluation are hosted in this OneDrive [folder](https://1drv.ms/f/c/b25b9b5879968c8a/EnT53j8Q9K1OntGtVnNbhvYBPY4Mg09QJeTjKiMpkx3_Jw).

<!-- ## Quickstart -->

## üôè Acknowledgement
The implementation of the codebase is partially adapted from [lemp](https://github.com/aaucsd/lemp.git).
